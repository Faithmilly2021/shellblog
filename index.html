<h1> What happens when you type ls *.c?</h1>
<p> The ls command tells the program to list all files and directories in the current working directory
    In this input however, there is asterisk that is added before ".c" The symbol of asterrisk matches 
    the characters  the characters that are placed after it, and tells the program to look for files that
     matches those same characters. For example  if you are putting ".c" you are telling the program to only
     list files that are with a ".c". As demonstrated below you could see how the files that are being displayed.
     With command ls -l *.c

    I will demostrate the steps that we have taken:
</h>
<ul> <li>Open your preferred editor</li></ul>
<ul><li> It can be Ubuntu, Git bash, Putty,</li></ul>
<ul><li>We have used Git bash</li></ul>
<ul><li>Open your git bash</li></ul>
<ul><li>and use cd ( that means go to your working directory)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Once your working directory has been open that's when you can use ls -l *.c</li></ul>
<ul><li>Working directory is My_Portfolio</li></ul>

    <p>
        The wildcard can be used in different circumstances as well. Let's say you want to write program
        that lists all the files that only start with letter "n". In this case, all once has to do is to
        place the asterisk after the character that you want to match.
